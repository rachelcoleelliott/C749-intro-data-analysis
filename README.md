# C749-intro-data-analysis

In this course project, I used Python to code in Jupyter Notebooks. I investigated the relationship between Babies per Woman (in each country, for the years 1800-2100) and three other factors.

The first relationship analyzed was the Human Development Index (HDI). This index is a measurement of quality of life based on factors such as life expectancy or health level, education, and per capita income. The official Human Development Reports site explains the following: "The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable, and having a decent standard of living." It is scored from 0 to 1.0.

The second dataset analyzed with Babies per Woman is the Happiness Score (WHR). In this survey, people in every country (where possible) answer the following: "Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?" The dataset has been converted to a 0-100 scale by GapMinder.

The third and final dataset is the suicide rates per 100k people in each country (where this data was provided).

All datasets were wrangled from the GapMinder website.
